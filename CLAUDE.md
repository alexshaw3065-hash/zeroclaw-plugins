# Project context for Claude Code

Read this fully before doing anything. This file is the persistent memory
for this project — treat conflicting assumptions from earlier in a
session as wrong if they contradict this file.

## What this is

A submission for the "Build Solana-native plugins for Zeroclaw" bounty
(Superteam Brasil, on Superteam Earn). Winner announcement: **August 21,
2026**. One pull request to `zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw-plugins`, containing
one shared core crate and three plugins ("Idea 1: The Smart Payment
Terminal" — see root README.md for the full pitch).

**The developer working with you is learning Rust and Solana at the same
time.** Prefer clear, well-commented code over clever code. Explain
non-obvious Rust patterns (lifetimes, trait bounds, `cfg` gating) briefly
in comments where they first appear. Don't assume prior familiarity with
Solana-specific concepts (PDAs, versioned transactions, durable nonces)
without a one-line reminder of what they are.

## The absolute rules — never violate these

1. **Custody tier ceiling: T1 maximum. Never build T2.** T0 = read only.
   T1 = builds an unsigned transaction or a Solana Pay URL, a human signs.
   Nothing in this repo may ever hold a signing key or submit a
   transaction. This was a deliberate, discussed decision — do not
   "helpfully" add signing capability even if it looks like a small step.
2. **Pure-core / thin-shim split, no exceptions.** All real logic lives
   in a plain Rust module with zero wasm dependencies, testable with
   plain `cargo test`. The `#[cfg(target_family = "wasm")]` shim only
   parses args, calls core, shapes the result, and makes the one allowed
   HTTP call. If you're about to put actual logic inside a `shim` module,
   stop and move it to `core` instead.
3. **No live network calls in tests, ever.** Mock RPC responses as
   literal JSON strings in test code. `cargo test` must pass with zero
   internet access.
4. **No secrets or hardcoded RPC URLs in code.** RPC endpoint comes from
   `config_read` at runtime, always user-overridable. Never commit a real
   API key anywhere, including in example config.
5. **Never print to stdout.** Use the structured logging import
   (`log-record`) once it's wired up — until then, don't add
   `println!`/`dbg!` debugging that could get left in.
6. **One component = one tool.** Never merge two plugins into one with an
   action enum, even if it seems more efficient. `token-risk-check`,
   `solana-pay-request`, and `payment-watch` stay three separate crates.

## Build order — follow this sequence, don't jump ahead

1. `solana-core` + `plugins/token-risk-check` — build and harden first.
2. `plugins/solana-pay-request` — next.
3. `plugins/payment-watch` — last, and only once 1 and 2 are solid. It's
   the hardest (chain polling, matching, and it calls into
   `zeroclaw_solana_core::risk::assess` internally — see below).

Each stopping point is a complete, submittable entry on its own. If time
runs short, stop at the end of a step, not mid-step.

## The one non-obvious design decision to preserve

`payment-watch` must call `zeroclaw_solana_core::risk::assess` **directly
as a function call**, on the mint that paid, before it reports a payment
as confirmed. This is not the LLM "remembering" to call
`token-risk-check` separately — it's hardcoded so it can't be skipped.
Both plugins import the exact same `assess()` function from
`solana-core`, so they can never disagree about what counts as safe. Keep
this fused; don't refactor it into two independent, unconnected plugins.

## Repo layout

```
solana-core/            pure Rust toolbox, no wasm deps, imported by all plugins
  src/pubkey.rs          base58 address parsing
  src/rpc.rs             JSON-RPC request building + response parsing (transport-agnostic)
  src/risk.rs            the shared scam-risk heuristic (assess())
plugins/
  token-risk-check/      T0 — built furthest along, use as the pattern for the other two
  solana-pay-request/    T1 — stubbed, TODO in README.md
  payment-watch/         T0 — stubbed, TODO in README.md, must call risk::assess()
```

Each plugin folder needs, before it's submittable (see its own README.md
for the per-plugin checklist): layout matching `plugins/redact-text`,
`manifest.toml` with minimal permissions, a README with custody tier +
threat model + worked example + prompt-injection transcript, and an MIT
LICENSE file.

## Known gaps — do these before anything else compiles for real

This scaffold was written without live access to the ZeroClaw repo (no
internet in the environment that generated it). Before writing new
feature code:

1. `git clone https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw-plugins` alongside
   this repo.
2. Diff `plugins/redact-text` (the canonical reference plugin) against
   this repo's layout and fix any mismatches.
3. Read the real `.wit` files under `wit/v0` and replace the placeholder
   `shim` module functions (marked `TODO` in each plugin's `src/lib.rs`)
   with real generated bindings. **wit/v0 is explicitly experimental —
   expect it to not match this scaffold exactly, and expect it to change
   again later.**
4. Look at `plugins/telegram` for a real published example of the
   `http_client` permission in use.
5. Run `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2` if not already installed.

## Commands

- `cargo test` — run from repo root, exercises all `core` modules across
  the workspace. Must pass with no network access. Run this after every
  change to any `core` module.
- `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release` — only expected to work
  once the shim TODOs above are resolved.

## Traps called out by the bounty sponsors — keep these in mind while coding

- **Blockhash expiry**: an unsigned tx sitting in an approval queue can
  go stale before a human signs it. Relevant once `payment-watch` /
  `solana-pay-request` build real transactions — durable nonce accounts
  are the fix, not yet implemented.
- **solana-sdk / solana-client don't work well for wasm32-wasip2.** Stay
  on `waki` + `serde_json` + `bs58` + hand-rolled encoding, not the
  official Solana Rust SDK.
- **Don't flood the context window.** Every plugin response must be
  short, shaped text (aim ~200 tokens), never raw RPC JSON dumps.
- **RPC key/URL only via config, never hardcoded.**

## Where the fuller story lives

- Root `README.md` — the full pitch, track mapping, and per-plugin status
  table.
- Each `plugins/*/README.md` — that plugin's custody tier writeup,
  threat model, and TODOs. Keep these updated as you build; they get
  submitted as-is.
